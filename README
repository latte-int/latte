This is LattE integrale, the official new version of LattE.

In addition to the traditional LattE function of counting lattice
points in polytopes by variants of Barvinok's algorithm, LattE
integrale can also compute volumes and integrate polynomial functions
over polytopes.  It supersedes LattE macchiato, an improved version of 
LattE.

LattE requires the following programs and libraries: 

  * GMP, compiled with --enable-cxx
  * NTL, version 5.4 or newer
  * cddlib
  * (optional) LRS
  * (optional) LiDIA
  * (optional) 4ti2
  * (optional) Maple (non-free)

If you do not have these libraries installed yet, follow the
instructions below to install them.  However, we also package a source
code distribution called

   "latte-integrale" 

(also called LattE integrale "for tea, too") that includes all of
these libraries (except, of course, Maple) and will build them
automatically.  You can get it at the same place where you got this
package,

Building and installing LattE
-----------------------------

It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use the source code distribution called
"latte-integrale".  It contains all prerequisite libraries and also
PATCHES for some of the libraries that fix configuration and build
problems that are not yet included in upstream releases of the library.

If you do not wish to use "latte-integrale", follow the instructions
below.  The instructions assume you want to install LattE and all its
prerequisites into your home directory, namely into a hierarchy rooted
at the directory $HOME/latte.

1. Install the GNU Multiple Precision Library

   Download it from http://www.swox.com/gmp/
   Unpack it, then in the source directory do:

     ./configure --prefix=$HOME/latte --enable-cxx
     make
     make install

2. Install Victor Shoup's Number Theoretic Library

   Obtain it from http://www.shoup.net/ntl/ 
   Unpack it, then in the source directory do:
   
      cd src
      ./configure PREFIX=$HOME/latte GMP_PREFIX=$HOME/latte NTL_GMP_LIP=on
      make
      make install

3. Install Komei Fukuda's package cddlib

   Obtain then from http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~fukuda/cdd_home

4. Put $HOME/latte/bin into your $PATH
   and $HOME/latte/lib into your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

      export PATH="$HOME/latte/bin:$PATH"
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/latte/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

5. Optionally, install the non-free library LiDIA.

   If you are using LiDIA 2.2.0, note that it installs the directory
   include/lidia but expects its header files in include/LiDIA.  We
   advise to put a symbolic link after installation of LiDIA.

6. Optionally, install 4ti2.

7. Optionally, if you have Maple, make sure that the directory where
   the command-line executable of Maple lives ("maple" or, on Windows,
   "cmaple.exe") is in your $PATH:

      export PATH="/path/to/maple/directory:$PATH"

N. Build and install LattE

   From the source directory of LattE:

      ./configure --prefix=$HOME/latte --with-default=$HOME/latte 
      make
      make install

Now the LattE executables (count, integrate, latte-minimize, latte-maximize, ...)
should be available in $HOME/latte/bin.
